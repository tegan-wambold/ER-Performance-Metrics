# ER-Performance-Metrics
This Power BI Report analyzes key emergency room performance metrics to understand how staffing, wait times, and patient satisfaction affect each other. 
The data for this was simulated based off of real-world emergency room dynamics and healthcare industry reports to create a realistic ER data set. 

# Questions
1. How do patient volume totals change across time of day, day of the week, and season/month of the year?
2. What, if any, bottlenecks occur while patients are waiting to be seen by a medical professional?
3. How do wait times affect patient satisfaction?
4. How do staffing levels (nurse-to-patient ratios) affect wait times and patient satisfaction?
5. How does urgency level of cases affect wait times and outcome?
6. How does case outcome affect patient satisfaction?

# Summary of Insights
1. ERs with lower nurse-to-patient ratios maintain shorter wait times and higher patient satisfactions.
2. Staffing effiency strongly correlates with operational performance.
3. Strategic resource allocation (by time of day and urgency level) can significantly improve patient satisfaction and outcomes.

# Future Improvements
1. Incorporate predictive modeling to forecast patient volumes and staffing needs.
2. Expand dashboard to include cost efficiency and patient flow metrics.
